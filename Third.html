                <h3>Health</h3>
                Your skin acts as a barrier to our internal systems that are imperative to our health and well-being. 
                Taking steps to properly care for our skin helps to ensure this important barrier is strong.
                When the skin is dry or irritated, cracks can occur, which make you more prone to infection.

               <h3>Beauty</h3>
                Who does not enjoy looking their best? It is important to take care of your skin as it helps it look more youthful. 
                As you age, your skin cells regenerate less frequently, which means your skin can start to show signs of aging 
                and lose that jovial radiance.

               <h3>Prevention</h3>
                Taking preventive measures with a well-thought-out skin care routine is essential to long-term skin health. 
                This can help you avoid the development of certain conditions and signs of aging,
                as well as reduce the severity of problems you may already be dealing with.<br>
